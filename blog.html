                        In the last three days, I've built the first screen of my first iOS app, started exploring the world of blockchain, and added new features - including Spotify embedded play buttons - to this website! Winter break started 5 days ago, but honestly, I don't think I've ever been more productive. Without the pressure of looming deadlines and time-driven projects, I've had time to truly focus on what I want.

                        And the tech side of me isn't the only part that has been reinvigorated. I've also had time to enjoy some of my more creative hobbies. I've found my way back to piano, <a href = "hobbies.html#books">reading</a>, photography, yoga, and obviously writing. Sometimes, with deadline after deadline, I forget to reflect on where I am and whether I'm moving in the direction of my goals. This week I was lucky enough to reflect on my first semester of college as I wandered through rose gardens and museums for hours at a time.

Mysterious and intimidating, he seemed to only hang out with guys - what was up with that? Throughout the year I admired his logical progressions, but I never really got to know him because of our language barrier. I could speak English, French, and Spanish, but he only spoke Java.

                        Flash-forward one year and call it fate! We met once again at a STEM summer camp and that was when our relationship truly developed. We were reintroduced, and I began to see computer science in a different light - it was the beginning of a beautiful relationship. He helped me pursue my passion for physics with computer models and even introduced me to Arduino boards.  By the end of the summer program, I was head over heels in love. Needless to say, we weren't just a summer fling. Here I am today, coding in honor of our 1 year anniversary!

                        So it always struck me as such a shame that airports are so busy, and people, so focused on their destinations. Thousands of untold stories and unique ideas pass through the airports every day, each one thought-provoking, a story that you might tell to your own children one day. They are untapped inspiration.

                        I love traveling solo and meeting new people with different world views, languages, and cultures. Regardless of whether the person in the seat next to me is a 4 year old French girl who likes to put socks on her hands, a retired computer science professor who now spends her time traveling the world, or a nervous man in his twenties headed off to give his first lecture, I always find that by the time I step off the plane my world is a little bigger than it was when I boarded. I challenge you to reach out the next time you find yourself in an airport! You never know what you might learn.

                        Today I woke up to the sound of waves on the shore and the sight of dolphins in the sea. Sound like heaven? It is, but it also goes by the name Cedar Key. It's where we go to escape to a day of scenic wildlife and fresh air in a tranquil town.

                        Sometimes when we arrive, I get the sense that we've somehow traveled 20 years back in time. The wooden restaurants that balance on top of the ocean, the way that your can tell nature still rules this town, and the number of people who take the time to say hi while taking a stroll make Cedar Key a rare and priceless gem in a world full of urbanized and bustling cities.

                    <p style="text-indent: 2.5rem">
                        It is the type of town that can charm you into waking up at the crack of dawn with the promise of dolphins dancing less than 10 feet away - the type of town where you can order seafood and know that it was fished from the ocean that morning - the type of town that tempts you with afternoon naps on the dock and entrances you with blushing sunsets on the horizon.

                        It was a long journey that I can’t fit into a single post, but I’ll tell you some things that made Eastside the best place for me these last 4 years.
                    </p>
                    <p style="text-indent: 2.5rem">
                        1. It was a rich experience where students were never afraid to chase their dreams or be unapologetically themselves. We were encouraged to take risks, reach out, and create community.
                    </p>
                    <p style="text-indent: 2.5rem">
                        2. Every student who chose Eastside knew the value of a well-rounded education and the benefit of being a “renaissance man/woman”. That’s why we learned a little philosophy in physics class, explored Michelangelo’s work in math class, did some cooking in chemistry class, and read about foreign affairs in French class. Our teachers inspired us to be multi-faceted learners, independent thinkers, and most importantly, global citizens.
                    </p>
                    <p style="text-indent: 2.5rem">
                        3. The IB program is not something you undergo alone. Your friends are the ones who will keep you sane and at the same time push you to become the best version of yourself. I know that realistically, I won’t be keeping all of my friends from high school, but I also know that the ones that I do keep will be forever, because we found ourselves with each other.
