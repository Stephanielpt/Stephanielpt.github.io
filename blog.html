                        If I was the new girl at school, then computer science was the sulky, badboy in the back of the classroom. Mysterious and intimidating, he seemed to only hang out with guys - what was up with that? Throughout the year I admired his logical progressions, but I never really got to know him because of our language barrier. I could speak English, French, and Spanish, but he only spoke Java.

                        Flash-forward one year and call it fate! We met once again at a STEM summer camp and that was when our relationship truly developed. We were reintroduced, and I began to see computer science in a different light - it was the beginning of a beautiful relationship. He helped me pursue my passion for physics with computer models and even introduced me to Arduino boards.  By the end of the summer program, I was head over heels in love. Needless to say, we weren't just a summer fling. Here I am today, coding in honor of our 1 year anniversary!

                        So it always struck me as such a shame that airports are so busy, and people, so focused on their destinations. Thousands of untold stories and unique ideas pass through the airports every day, each one thought-provoking, a story that you might tell to your own children one day. They are untapped inspiration.

                        I love traveling solo and meeting new people with different world views, languages, and cultures. Regardless of whether the person in the seat next to me is a 4 year old French girl who likes to put socks on her hands, a retired computer science professor who now spends her time traveling the world, or a nervous man in his twenties headed off to give his first lecture, I always find that by the time I step off the plane my world is a little bigger than it was when I boarded. I challenge you to reach out the next time you find yourself in an airport! You never know what you might learn.

                        Today I woke up to the sound of waves on the shore and the sight of dolphins in the sea. Sound like heaven? It is, but it also goes by the name Cedar Key. It's where we go to escape to a day of scenic wildlife and fresh air in a tranquil town.
                    </p>

                        Sometimes when we arrive, I get the sense that we've somehow traveled 20 years back in time. The wooden restaurants that balance on top of the ocean, the way that your can tell nature still rules this town, and the number of people who take the time to say hi while taking a stroll make Cedar Key a rare and priceless gem in a world full of urbanized and bustling cities.
                    </p>
                    <p style="text-indent: 2.5rem">
                        It is the type of town that can charm you into waking up at the crack of dawn with the promise of dolphins dancing less than 10 feet away - the type of town where you can order seafood and know that it was fished from the ocean that morning - the type of town that tempts you with afternoon naps on the dock and entrances you with blushing sunsets on the horizon.
