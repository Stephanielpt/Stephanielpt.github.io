                        Happy Mother's Day Mamasita! This is a digital card, since all your kids are real techies now, haha. It also makes it so that this card is now impossible to lose :) The digital world is kind of cool.

                       A woman of many names - Shirley, Marie, Backhand boss, Stock connaisseur, Curry chef, Swim mom, Mathemagician, Fashionista, Role model, but I get to call you mom (or mamasita haha) - and that's what makes me so lucky. You're strong, independent, capable, and so many other things I aspire to be. Every day you balance kids, work, rentals, stocks, and the household. You're a real-life superhero, who has always supported me since day one. 18 years ago, you fed me milk when I woke up hungry every hour as a baby, and now, even though I'm in college across the country - you still send me your delicious cooking all the time, but through pictures!

                    <p style="text-indent: 2.5rem">
                       You've been with me through the most important parts of my life. You taught me how to read, how to be honest (especially because you're practically a lie detector), how to swim, how to drive, how to cook, how to do stocks!! I can't think of anyone better to have stood by my side all these years. When coach said warmup was at 6:00am, I wasn't the only person who had to wake up - you would wake up just to drop me off. Whenever I got sick - you had to take sick leave. You were always with me. I always felt supported and loved, because even when you're mad at me I know it's because you care <3 I couldn't be prouder to call you my Mom, and hope that you know when I call you "Mom", it stands for so much more than just a name.

                        Happy Mother's Day. I hope that you can take this day to relax because you are very special to all of your children. You always help us with our problems and you have a strong devotion to your children that has greatly influenced me as a person. It takes a lot of effort to make good children and you definitely have at least 2 good children (Hopefully you'll end up having 3 good children). You always perservere in difficult circumstances such as when Kelly lost her purse, wallet and phone; you are always confident and when I need something to get done quickly you always help me such as when I need to order a book for school or need a ride to school and you play a big role in my day to day life by doing things like packing my lunch (which I plan on doing from now on starting tomorrow), cooking dinner and encouraging me to do stuff and focus.
                        Thank you for all of your sacrifices, Ryan
