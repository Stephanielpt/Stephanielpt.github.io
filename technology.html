                        ...was my favorite programming project. To think that this website was created with just some files of code blows my mind, and I hope that never changes. There's so much left for me to uncover in the world of computer science - and it truly is a whole other world, with its own languages, laws, and class divisions. This is my third time creating a website and each time I do, I get a better grasp on the concepts of HTML and CSS and a better idea of what my ideal website looks like. This time around I went for a minimalist and functional design. I got to call the shots because this website was all for me. Being able to research and then implement all of my "what if's" was beyond satisfying. I finished most of the website within 5 hours, but it was the extra efforts like getting the menu bar to stay at the top of the page, learning responsive design and creating hover images, where I had the most fun.

                        And now I not only have more experience in web design, but I also have my own blog. For me, this website serves as an outlet, a place for reflection, a reason to take more pictures, and something I can call my own. Like all art, it started as an idea, but with a little inspiration and a lot of research, it became something interesting enough for you to be reading right now. This summer I hope to feed my inner artist my creating and sharing everything. I want to write my own songs, program an organizational app, cook new dishes, design unique outfits, and write pieces just like this one. Here's to a summer of creation.

                        My Arduino board gives me the opportunity to blend my love for the tangible physics of hardware and the fluid computer code of software. Whether I'm creating a light display or pulsing the current through electromagnets, I love the new aspect of computer science that my board allows me to tap into.

                        I love the feeling I get when I see my code and Arduino replicate something I've seen in tech before. The real-life applications are what make each project so satisfying. With my Arduino by my side, I have come to understand more about the behind-the-scenes of everyday objects like MP3 players, LEDs, and video gaming consoles.

                        This summer I created a computer model of a six-star orbiting system.

                        Not going to lie, it was incredibly intimidating at first, but it proved to be just as fun as it was challenging. I had to use the Newton's Laws of Gravitation to dictate how stars reacted to the others stars nearby. On top of that, I had to use 3D trigonometry to ensure the stars all started in an orientation that would allow them to maintain orbit around each other. We wouldn't want all of them to be attracted to an abnormally massive star and collide!

                        The orbits turned out to be beautiful and I was even able to create a self-sustaining  nine-star orbiting system (see above!)
