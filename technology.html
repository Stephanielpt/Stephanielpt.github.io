                        I can’t believe it has been only a month since I first “pushed” this website into the world! They grow up so fast! Within the past few weeks, I’ve learned more than I could have imagined. In addition to learning HTML and CSS, because I chose to host my website on GitHub Pages, I am now familiar with GitHub and comfortable using the terminal to navigate my computer.

                        My most recent mini project on my website was implementing JavaScript, which I love because it incorporates logical progressions that I have been missing in HTML and also makes my website more dynamic. I hope to incorporate even more interactive features using JavaScript and jQuery in the next few months.

                        This Summer I wanted to figure out: what am I really getting into by pursuing the path of a programmer? Luckily, because I live in a college town, I didn’t have to search too far to find my answers. I secured a spot as a volunteer in a simulation lab, and got to see the code behind programs that were used to teach med students proper technique for medical procedures.

                    <p style="text-indent: 2.5rem">
                        I learned Unity and C# to produce a new feature for a teaching simulation. The project was meaningful because I was no longer coding for myself, a class, or my personal website. I knew my code would have far-reaching effects and be used to help people.

                        ...was my favorite programming project. To think that this website was created with just some files of code blows my mind, and I hope that never changes. There's so much left for me to uncover in the world of computer science - and it truly is a whole other world, with its own languages, laws, and class divisions. This is my third time creating a website and each time I do, I get a better grasp on the concepts of HTML and CSS and a better idea of what my ideal website looks like. This time around I went for a minimalist and functional design. I got to call the shots because this website was all for me. Being able to research and then implement all of my "what if's" was beyond satisfying. I finished most of the website within 5 hours, but it was the extra efforts like getting the menu bar to stay at the top of the page, learning responsive design and creating hover images, where I had the most fun.

                        And now I not only have more experience in web design, but I also have my own blog. For me, this website serves as an outlet, a place for reflection, a reason to take more pictures, and something I can call my own. Like all art, it started as an idea, but with a little inspiration and a lot of research, it became something interesting enough for you to be reading right now. This summer I hope to feed my inner artist my creating and sharing everything. I want to write my own songs, program an organizational app, cook new dishes, design unique outfits, and write pieces just like this one. Here's to a summer of creation.

                        Not going to lie, it was incredibly intimidating at first, but it proved to be just as fun as it was challenging. I had to use the Newton's Laws of Gravitation to dictate how stars reacted to the others stars nearby. On top of that, I had to use 3D trigonometry to ensure the stars all started in an orientation that would allow them to maintain orbit around each other. We wouldn't want all of them to be attracted to an abnormally massive star and collide!

                        The orbits turned out to be beautiful and I was even able to create a self-sustaining  nine-star orbiting system (see above!)
