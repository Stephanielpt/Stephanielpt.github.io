                    <p style="text-indent: 2.5rem">
                        Facebook University introduced me to the most inspiring and passionate people this summer. Within my cohort, I found amazing friends, and the best teammates I could have asked for. Within the first three weeks, we ramped up from 0 to 100, and built three apps, just to learn some iOS basics. During the rest of the summer, I worked with my two teammates to develop a full-fledged app from start to finish. We chose everything from the big idea to every little feature, which was one of the coolest parts for me. 
                    </p>
                    <p style="text-indent: 2.5rem">
                        In some ways, the summer felt like a 2 month long hackathon, and my team's final product was "Fetch." Fetch is a map-based, item-sharing app. It's practical, and straighforward - it targets the pain-points of renting, but most importantly, it's something we had worked towards and devoted significant time to for 5 weeks. During that time, I was learning more than just technical iOS skills, I was also learning about how to organize a long term project. We created sprints, user stories, and git issues and branches for our project, and they helped us work well as a team and stay focused on our goals. After 5 weeks of development, we demoed to Denise Hernandez, and were ecstatic to find out that we were chosen to demo Fetch again that week, but this time, to Mark Zuckerberg. 
                    </p>
                    <p style="text-indent: 2.5rem">
                        On my last day, it was so hard to say goodbye, but I knew I was walking away with new friends, new inspiration, and a new outlook that would stick with me long after the end of my internship.

                        If I was the new girl at school, then computer science was the sulky, badboy in the back of the classroom. Mysterious and intimidating, he seemed to only hang out with guys - what was up with that? Throughout the year I admired his logical progressions, but I never really got to know him because of our language barrier. I could speak English, French, and Spanish, but he only spoke Java.
                    </p>
                    <p style="text-indent: 2.5rem">
                        Flash-forward one year and call it fate! We met once again at a STEM summer camp and that was when our relationship truly developed. We were reintroduced, and I began to see computer science in a different light - it was the beginning of a beautiful relationship. He helped me pursue my passion for physics with computer models and even introduced me to Arduino boards.  By the end of the summer program, I was head over heels in love. Needless to say, we weren't just a summer fling. Here I am today, coding in honor of our 1 year anniversary!

                        It started with a web app for sharing and organizing internship opportunities. Then I switched to something more tangible by learning CAD to 3D print Baymax's head. Most recently, my own idea was brought to life as a web app for detecting where the most activity is on campus.

                        What can I say? After the first hackathon I was hooked. Not just the by technology though! The hackers, the mentors, organizers, my team members - they all made the sleepless hours so incredibly worth it. 
                    </p>
                    <p style="text-indent: 2.5rem">
                        I learned and accomplished more than I could've dreamed at each hackathon. I was working on technology for more than a grade and more than just myself. I loved bringing the team's idea to life and meeting new people with different skills, strengths, and personalities. By the end of the event, everyone comes out of the weekend with so much more than we entered with! We learn from each other, grow on one another, and create an app together, what more could I ask for?

                        ...was my favorite programming project. To think that this website was created with just some files of code blows my mind, and I hope that never changes. There's so much left for me to uncover in the world of computer science - and it truly is a whole other world, with its own languages, laws, and class divisions. This is my third time creating a website and each time I do, I get a better grasp on the concepts of HTML and CSS and a better idea of what my ideal website looks like. This time around I went for a minimalist and functional design. I got to call the shots because this website was all for me. Being able to research and then implement all of my "what if's" was beyond satisfying. I finished most of the website within 5 hours, but it was the extra efforts like getting the menu bar to stay at the top of the page, learning responsive design and creating hover images, where I had the most fun.

                        And now I not only have more experience in web design, but I also have my own blog. For me, this website serves as an outlet, a place for reflection, a reason to take more pictures, and something I can call my own. Like all art, it started as an idea, but with a little inspiration and a lot of research, it became something interesting enough for you to be reading right now. This summer I hope to feed my inner artist by creating and sharing everything. I want to write my own songs, program an organizational app, cook new dishes, design unique outfits, and write pieces just like this one. Here's to a summer of creation.

                        It works just like ISR's we learned about in electrical engineering. At the beginning of the year, we had our software constantly checking on the status of all the hardware parts from a while loop. This is called polling, and as I soon realized - extremely inefficient. Later in the year, we programmed ISR's or interrupt service routines. Interrupts let the program know when a key change has occurred by <i>interrupting</i> the program, and this makes keeping tabs on hardware much easier - and time efficient.

                        The project was also connected to my ventures in web development. The same identifiers that I used to format my HTML could be used to target specific information on a long cluttered website. This parsing turned out to be pretty helpful for me and my friends this semester when registering for classes, and I'm sure it will continue to keep up to date with whatever life throws my way.

                        Not going to lie, it was incredibly intimidating at first, but it proved to be just as fun as it was challenging. I had to use the Newton's Laws of Gravitation to dictate how stars reacted to the others stars nearby. On top of that, I had to use 3D trigonometry to ensure the stars all started in an orientation that would allow them to maintain orbit around each other. We wouldn't want all of them to be attracted to an abnormally massive star and collide!

                        After years of counting milliseconds as a competitive swimmer, I fell in love with Zumba, where I dance until I lose track of time. Here, I can swing my hips to Batchata, Merengue, Hip-hop, Salsa, Reggaeton, anything I'd like...

                        That's the general definition of Zumba, but my Zumba class is anything but normal, because it isn't always the music or the dance moves that make a good class, I think that I truly fell for the people. I fell for the energy of a room full of middle-aged women, getting down and hollering, screaming spanish lyrics to their favorite songs, improvising moves and adding their own flair to each step.
                        From the outside looking in, we are only dancing, but open the door, step inside our studio, and I promise you will see something you've never seen before.

                    <p style="text-indent: 2.5rem">
                        We follow the music. We dance with heart and move with soul. I love it more than singing, because when I sing the music reaches my mouth, but with dancing it touches my entire body.

                        I've always been conscious about what foods I put into my body. As a swimmer I had to be, but this summer I decided to conquer the kitchen, to prepare my own meals and fuel my body with only the best ingredients. I decided to start my cooking adventures in Greece, and my first dish was a baked Meditteranean Chicken. The recipe called for at least 15 different spices and my mom taught me that in cooking I could be a little more creative than in baking. We altered the recipe and added some lemon juice and white wine to enhance the flavors and voila! Success! We ate it with everything from pita to french bread and found it went especially well with avocado.
                    </p>
                    <p style="text-indent: 2.5rem">
                        I followed it up with several other Meditterarean style dishes that often starred tomatoes, cucumbers, garbanzo beans, feta, and of course, lemon juice and oregano.

                        My next culinary destination was influenced by Cubano, Erick Brian Colón. I made typical cuban Frijoles Negroes and put them in flavorful Arroz Morros. And of course, Pastelitos de Guyaba were eaten and Cuban Tostadas were made.
