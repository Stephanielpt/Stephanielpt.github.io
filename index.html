De los videos, he visto que el es comico y por que el es el unico que todavía está en la escuela, sé que el es intelectual. Cuando Erick canta, quiero escucharlo por el resto de mi vida.

                        So it always struck me as such a shame that airports are so busy, and people, so focused on their destinations. Thousands of untold stories and unique ideas pass through the airports every day, each one thought-provoking, a story that you might tell to your own children one day. They are untapped inspiration.

                        I love traveling solo and meeting new people with different world views, languages, and cultures. Regardless of whether the person in the seat next to me is a 4 year old French girl who likes to put socks on her hands, a retired computer science professor who now spends her time traveling the world, or a nervous man in his twenties headed off give his first lecture, I always find that by the time I step off the plane my world is a little bigger than it was when I boarded.

                        ...was my favorite programming project. To think that this website was created with just some files of code blows my mind, and I hope that never changes. There's so much left for me to uncover in the world of computer science - and it truly is a whole other world, with its own languages, laws, and class divisions. This is my third time creating a website and each time I do, I get a better grasp on the concepts of HTML and CSS and a better idea of what my ideal website looks like. This time around I went for a minimalist and functional design. I got to call the shots because this website was all for me. Being able to research and then implement all of my "what if's" was beyond satisfying. I finished most of the website within 5 hours, but it was the extra efforts like getting the menu bar to stay at the top of the page, learning responsive design and creating hover images, where I had the most fun.

                        And now I not only have more experience in web design, but I also have my own blog. For me, this website serves as an outlet, a place for reflection, a reason to take more pictures, and something I can call my own. Like all art, it started as an idea, but with a little inspiration and a lot of research, it became something interesting enough for you to be reading right now. This summer I hope to feed my inner artist my creating and sharing everything. I want to write my own songs, program an organizational app, cook new dishes, design unique outfits, and write pieces just like this one. Here's to a summer of creation.

                        Today I woke up to the sound of waves on the shore and the sight of dolphins in the sea. Sound like heaven? It is, but it also goes by the name Cedar Key. It's where we go to escape to a day of scenic wildlife and fresh air in a tranquil town.

                        Sometimes when we arrive, I get the sense that we've somehow traveled 20 years back in time. The wooden restaurants that balance on top of the ocean, the way that your can tell nature still rules this town, and the number of people who take the time to say hi while taking a stroll make Cedar Key a rare and priceless gem in a world full of urbanized and bustling cities.

                        It is the type of town that can charm you into waking up at the crack of dawn with the promise of dolphins dancing less than 10 feet away - the type of town where you can order seafood and know that it was fished from the ocean that morning - the type of town that tempts you with afternoon naps on the dock and entrances you with blushing sunsets on the horizon.

                        After years of counting milliseconds as a competitive swimmer, I fell in love with Zumba, where I dance until I lose track of time. Here, I can swing my hips to Batchata, Merengue, Hip-hop, Salsa, Reggaeton, anything I'd like... 
                    </p>
                    <p style="text-indent: 2.5rem">
                        That's the general definition of Zumba, but my Zumba class is anything but normal, because it isn't always the music or the dance moves that make a good class, I think that I truly fell for the people. I fell for the energy of a room full of middle-aged women, getting down and hollering, screaming spanish lyrics to their favorite songs, improvising moves and adding their own flair to each step.
                        From the outside looking in, we are only dancing, but open the door, step inside our studio, and I promise you will see something you've never seen before.
                    </p>
                    <p style="text-indent: 2.5rem">
                        We follow the music. We dance with heart and move with soul. I love it more than singing, because when I sing the music reaches my mouth, but with dancing it touches my entire body.

                        I've always been conscious about what foods I put into my body. As a swimmer I had to be, but this summer I decided to conquer the kitchen, to prepare my own meals and fuel my body with only the best ingredients. I decided to start my cooking adventures in Greece, and my first dish was a baked Meditteranean Chicken. The recipe called for at least 15 different spices and my mom taught me that in cooking I could be a little more creative than in baking. We altered the recipe and added some lemon juice and white wine to enhance the flavors and voila! Success! We ate it with everything from pita to french bread and found it went especially well with avocado.
                    </p>
                    <p style="text-indent: 2.5rem">
                        I followed it up with several other Meditterarean style dishes that often starred tomatoes, cucumbers, garbanzo beans, feta, and of course, lemon juice and oregano.

                        My next culinary destination was influenced by Cubano, Erick Brian Colón. I made typical cuban Frijoles Negroes and put them in flavorful Arroz Morros. And of couse Pastelitos de Guyaba were eaten and cuban tostados were made.

                        My Arduino board gives me the opportunity to blend my love for the tangible physics of hardware and the fluid computer code of software. Whether I'm creating a light display or pulsing the current through electromagnets, I love the new aspect of computer science that my board allows me to tap into.

                        I love the feeling I get when I see my code and Arduino replicate something I've seen in tech before. The real-life applications are what make each project so satisfying. With my Arduino by my side, I have come to understand more about the behind-the-scenes of everyday objects like MP3 players, LEDs, and video gaming consoles.

                        This summer I created a computer model of a six-star orbiting system.

                        Not going to lie, it was incredibly intimidating at first, but it proved to be just as fun as it was challenging. I had to use the Newton's Laws of Gravitation to dictate how stars reacted to the others stars nearby. On top of that, I had to use 3D trigonometry to ensure the stars all started in an orientation that would allow them to maintain orbit around each other. We wouldn't want all of them to be attracted to an abnormally massive star and collide!

                        The orbits turned out to be beautiful and I was even able to create a self-sustaining  nine-star orbiting system (see above!)
