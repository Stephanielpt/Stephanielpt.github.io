                    This is my attempt at a minimalistic site! I'm getting pretty interested in design so this is a way to link back into the several different designs that I have explored for my website :)

                    I'm Stephanie and I grew up in Gainesville, Florida, but am crossing the country to pursue my dreams in Los Angeles, California.

                    I call myself a multipotentialite because ever since I was a child, I fascinated myself with everything from musical performance to medicine, fashion design and physics, technology and theatre, psychology and sports.

                    I don't believe that that we can classify humans into jock, nerd, diva in the same way we classify variables as int, float, boolean. I thrive at the intersection of all my passions, because that is where innovation happens, so join me on my journey to live life to its fullest.
